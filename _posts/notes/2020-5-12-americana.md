**The history of American Capitalism can be divided into 6 main eras**
<ul>
<li><mark>1620 - 1790</mark>: arrival of the Mayflower and Virginia company, tobacco-based economy with exports going back to Britain, taxation and Declaration of Independence </li>
<li><mark>1790 - 1860</mark>: creation of steam engine -> steamboats, railroads, invention of telegraph, gold rush and confidence in paper money, slave trade supporting cotton industry</li>
<li><mark>1860 - 1885</mark>: robber barons (railroads, oil, steel), national markets built on abstraction of brand, Edison's electricity system, era of consumption/specialization</li>
<li><mark>1885 - 1910</mark>: labor union push and Roosevelt breaking up trusts, Pulitzer revitalizing newspaper consumption, Ford's emphasis on division of labor</li>
<li><mark>1910 - 1960</mark>: increased government regulation with radio and alcohol, Hoover's self-correcting markets idea and later Reagan's trickle down economics, focus on building homes in suburbia and laying down highways for more efficient transportation</li>
<li><mark>1960 - 2007</mark>: technological revolution as a form of cold-war defense, conflict between corporation and capitalists, black men achieving social mobility through sports or music, information superhighway and rebirth of Apple through globalism</li>
</ul>

**Main points**
- <mark>Could easily argue that American capitalism not really free market forces at work ... ex: tariffs for domestic producers, home loans federally guaranteed, bank deposits federally insured, tech innovation (Internet, computing, radio) through military expenditure, automaker bailouts</mark>
    - Capitalism endlessly calibrated balance between state subsidies + social programs + regulation and free markets 
- <mark>Nativist = saw jobs leaving, globalist = saw standard of living improving ... common misbelief that America no longer produced anything, but WE DID</mark>
    - For example, foreign auto manufacturers opened up plants here, still big on drilling, make planes, pharmaceutical companies + medical devices
- <mark>Root of American discontent = roots in nostalgia in former glory, but was there ever glory?</mark>
    - 1930's = depression, 1940's = World War 2, 1950's = Korean War + preparing for nuclear war, 1960's = Vietnam + riots, 1970's = oil + economic crisis + high inflation, 1980's = AIDS fear + street crime
    - However, income inequality has led to progress in quality of life, made racial progress, new technological progress 
- <mark>Technological progress -> shut most Americans out of production ... every worker used to be both a producer and a consumer, but now he was simply a high-value consumer</mark>
    - THIS IS THE PARADOX OF AMERICA

**Chapter summaries**

- The financing of the Mayflower, the very first venture from Europe to America was a display of the earliest forms of capitalism - investors contributing to the funds required for transport, food, initial settlement, etc. in exchange for a piece of the Virgina Company 
    - **Joint-stock allowed for shares to be traded in comparison to the closer nature of a partnership, additionally, limited personal liability of investors** -> limited downside, unlimited upside -> encouraged private capital investment
- Export of tobacco back to England served as the foundation for the economy in the South and led to an influx of immigrants hoping to pursue a new life 
    - **Indentured servitude made a lot more sense than owning slaves at the time, as slaves were expensive and had a high mortality rate**, while mortality to indentured servants could even be beneficial to a landowner
    - Economics of servitude soon began to move towards slavery as more and more white settlers arrived, meaning that the best land became more and more valuable
- As Britain began to impose its will onto America, the Americans attempted to boycott British goods or straight up destroy them, resulting in a back and forth tax-rebel cycle that culminated in the Declaration of Indendence
    - Jefferson's main argument was that these ventures were initially funded by private interests, but as they began to see success the public was unfairly assuming power over these foreign colonies  
<br/>

- The creation of the steam engine marked the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and created a problem that was solved with the invention of the cotton gin, which exemplified Adam Smith's "division of labor" theory
    - Steam power -> mechanization of clothing -> cotton gin ... Eli Whitney
    - <mark>In his Wealth of Nations in 1776, Adam Smith talked about the important of the division of labor -> specialization -> work decreased, but instead of the need for labor decreasing, people would be able to afford more as prices fell -> standard of living rose -> widen market for goods -> creation of jobs</mark>
- The **state offering an exclusive monopoly on waterways to incentivize the invention of the steamboat was one of the first examples of capitalism as a public-private joint venture**
    - Vanderbilt was known as the low-cost operator, would decrease his prices 50-75% below incumbent -> cause pain and get bought out ... he established himself as the anti-monopolist, looking down on men unable to compete 
- Now that people were moving across country, canals allowed steamboats to expand the reach of land that people could use for agricultural purposes, as America was an agrarian society at this time -> creation of modern society
    - Now that the idea of building a massive canal was revisited - main problem = can it be federally financed? Would present unequal benefit to certain states over others .... led to idea that federal government's job more than just protection
- **Rise of railroads in 1830's -> use of 'corporation' -> obtaining a charter with specific purpose -> shielder passive investors from liabilities -> encouraged shareholdings + frictionless transfer of shares** (railroads financed through stock, canals through bonds)
- The telegraph encouraged innovation in a lot of different industries and was the first succesful application of the licensing model, which is what ultimately allowed the infrastructure to be laid out so fast
    - At this point, electricity had no commerical application - but now everyone understood that value of this "instant" movement through time/space (newspapers for news, stock markets for buying cheaply + selling higher, railroads for tracking progress)
    - Morse licensed his technology (unlike Whitney, who tried doing everything himself) and created a revenue stream for himself - everyone was now in a frenzy to set up telecommunications infrastructure
- Flood of gold helped unleash economic activity throughout the world -> large amounts of gold = confidence in paper money boomed
    - Just as legal framework for patents, bond agreements, LLC led to economic progress, **influx of gold allowed the central banking systems of these industrial economies to keep pace with scientific/technological progress**
- The **argument for retaining slaves was rooted in preservation of principal, but as the value of slaves started to rise, this price ultimately became decoupled from cotton prices** (which were supposed to be correlated) - caused people to perceive that slavery was worth a lot more than it actually was 
    - Lots of settlers did not like the idea of slavery, because it gave the established plantation owners a huge advantage - additionally, this sort of manual work began to become associated with slavery and ultimately a source of humiliation 
    - In 1859, all the slaves were worth a collective $3 billion, railroads were worth $1 billion, US government spent $69 million - slaves were the most valuable asset class in America 
    - Because slaves could be used as collateral, gave slave-owners a huge degree of liquidity and allowed them to borrow money to fund any capital expenditures  
<br/>

- Throughout the Civil War, the North found itself in midst of commercial renaissance ... **Jefferson's vision of limited government lost out to Hamilton's vision of federalism (need a government that could operate at scale efficiently)**
    - Passed the Legal Tender Act, which increased the circulation of money and mandated that all parties had to accept paper money ... government spending increased from 69 million to 474 million (about 6x)
- Standard Oil displayed the paradox of American capitalism - **instead of it being a marketplace of competition, people began to see the efficiences of consolidation -> easier to coordinate activites, achieve economies of scale, borrow cheapy** .... industrialization also increased the standard of living for most Americans by making basic things more affordable 
    - Rockefeller had great knowledge of economies of scale - wanted to keep borrowing and expanding (even if it meant forgoing current profits)
    - Oil producers negotiated collectively to pay listed rates but receive back a part of their shipping fee (competitive advantage), Standard Oil ultimately convinced smaller oil refiners to join them by cryptically presenting impending power of South Improvement Company
- The steel industry showed that there are **two potential approached to business - be as efficient as possible with the lowest costs to eliminate competition (takes a long time though and customers get used to low prices) or limit supply collectively to fix prices**
    - Years of wartime spending, easy credit = robust economic activity, which masked the waste and inefficiency -> Jay Cooke's railroad failed, and men rushed to liquidate all assets + get hands on cash
- German beer brand's made it clear that brands could sometimes be worth more than all the facilities, bottling machines, warehouse combined ... led to an era of national markets that were built on the abstraction of a brand (many times these brands happened to be machine-makers)
- Edison's electricity system and prior inventions showed the important of patents, property rights that were able to attract capital and commercialize (bring to market) inventions ... **exclusive rights for a certain period of time encouraged expensive experimentation + the ability to profit from risk**
<ul><li>
This new era of specialization + consumption coinced with an emerging wage structure of the industrial economy -> middle-class homes were a consumptive unit ... the emergence of catalogs led to false claims, which required a force outside the market (the government) to play referee
</li></ul>  <br/>

- The labor union push proved that American capitalism wasn't ideologically rigid - it continued to juggle competing and contradictory ideas ... eventually found political solutions to issues that seemed impossible to solve (middle ground forged by clash between democracy and capitalism -> regulatory framework to govern economy system)
    - Idea that anyone can rise to the top in this capitalist system is flawed, as most laboring men are always going to be laboring men ... if the only way to improve your condition is to move beyond the level of labor, something is flawed
    - **Conflict between Adam Smith's wealth of nations and labor unions - Adam Smith claimed that freedoom of contract would always lead to a fair outcome between buyer and seller, but these enterprises had gotten so big that they had enormous negotiating leverage**
    - Carnegie put forth theories of capitalism in his "Gospel of Wealth," defending the system by saying that it allows for commodities at low prices (allowing for poor to enjoy what rich could previosuly not afford) ... Srinivisan says that the price to this material progress + "cheap comforts" was massive income inequality 
    - <mark>Carnegie vs Frick = Carnegie's homestead plant made capital investments into new technology -> production capacity increased -> fewer skilled men needed .... worker productivity went up but steel prices went down .... became a zero-sum equation, meaning that worker wages remained stagnant (since their wages were a function of productivity and steel price) ... why is increased productivity attributed only to technological investment?</mark>
- Pulitzer revolutionized newspaper consumption by introducing populist elements and tried to grab the attention of readers with a large cartoon rather than focusing on politics/legislative process ... Hearts also tried to appeal to the working class by focusing on William Jennings Bryan 
    - Republicans = if you make the rich more prosperous, the prosperity wil leak to the bottom ... Democrats = if you make masses prosperous, it will leak through to the top
    - Gold = kept value of money stable, but increased scarsity -> strengthening gold reserves competed with privative interests and reduced supply of money in economy -> deflation
- JP Morgan believed that **free market competition led to irrational price wars, which means volatility -> thus, to achieve stability, large investors decided to limit free market competition through trusts**  ... did not want to risk commodity business seeing their profit margins continuing to be reduced by competition
    - Roosevelt acknowledged that the industrial development and the end of the 19th century was acceleraring so fast that the old laws were no longer sufficient to regulate the accumulation + distribution of wealth ... justified this because corporation was government-sanctioned and didn't exist in nature, so government has full power to regulate them
- Minimize-all costs + maximize-all yield approach was very prevalent in the food industry and benefited working class family by bringing prices down, but led to meatpackers cutting a lot of corners
    - **American capitalism no longer laissez-faire and required counterbalancing force to correct for excess, regulate for consumer safety**
- Egalitarianism was counter-argument to capitalism ... Ford creating precedent for automaking manufacturers to start by focusing on speed (demonstrated engineering superiority) which was also an investment in marketing
    - This was the first invention that was solely the product of the tinkerer (steamboat = monopoly grant, railroad = eminent domain, telegraph = $30,000 grant, cotton = state-sanctioned slavery, steel = tariffs)  
<br/>

- Radio was best example of a technology where the government had to come in to regulate
    - **If anyone could transmit on any frequency at any time, then entire technology would become useless for everyone** ... however, radio was invisible (meaning, who owned the air? how could someone have property rights for the radio?)
- Progressive era = **appreciation for government as a check on free markets, but many came to appreciate that the market could also be a check on government** ... merely added a price premium for alcohol (although alcohol tax no longer had to be paid)
    - Consumer demand was still very strong, 18th amendment led to paying off police, judges, politicans -> unregulated market 
- **Hoover believed that markets were self-correcting (would eventually correct for excesses and failures would serve as moral lessons), but reality was that economy was more inter-connected than he thought** ... money retreating + failure in one area could lead to a lot of collateral damange 
    - Options to stimulate economy = reduce taxes, have Federal Reserve buy bonds to infuse cash into the economy, lower interest rates to stimulate banks borrowing from each other ... Hoover was commited to the gold standard as he did not want to weaken the  currency -> restricted suppy of money -> deflation set in, meaning prices lower but dollars also harder to come by
    - Many banks failed because people owed the bank more than what the bank owed depositors ... banks could not immediate liquidate to satisfy the demands of everyone that wanted to withdraw their money -> Bank of the United States (still a private bank) failed
    - <mark>Government's role was now expanded to management of economy ... which seemed a departure from capitalism -> prolonged economic failure was now seen as policy failure of government, not the markets</mark>
- Charles Lindberg was continually hosted by the Germans to showcase their aviation superiority ... Americans now wanted the world to deviate away from communism and attempted to export their template of capitalism (considered as a system to strengthen human freedom and creativity)
    - War showed that central planning could not only coordinate resources but force innovation (ex: Manhattan project, military tech, computing) - **contradicted the notion that only profit motive could incentive invention or production**
- Home builders wanted to follow the same formula that Ford had laid out - to achieve good quality and price, you had to follow the same steps over and over ... effect of new homes was source of people being drained from city -> into suburbs, communities centered around male commuters, female housewives, raising children
    - Suburbia = washing away ethnicity and had a uniform whiteness ... **it was the public school districts that unified these communities, property tax when to ensuring that children had access to good education, as education was the primary measure that determined these property values**
    - Government backed loans from the FHA, but FHA gauged the quality of residential neighbourhoods and "protection from adverse influences" - this allowed the home sellers to discriminate against certain racial groups
- Rise of television and film allowed Reagan to create his following - he transformed from a self-described "liberal Democrat" to America's most vocal proponent of free enterprise
- Construction of highways predicated on the cold war rationale that military equipment needed to be mobilized quickly ... new highways had detrimental effects on the economies of small towns that were along the way
    - Creation of franchies (McDonalds, KFC) that revealed duality of capitalism, where entreprenuer could make money off of proven ideas  
<br/>

- Military-industrial complex started the technological revolution -> started out as a form of cold-war defense, government continued to spend money on science, technology, computing
    - **Difference between Soviet and American programs was that Americans relied on contracts with private suppliers (subsidized R&D during initial efforts, leading to discoveries in residual efforts) while Soviets only had the central planning stage, not the second stage**
    - Use of semiconductors allowed for easier, faster, more reliable manipulation of electricity = all necessary for computing, with NASA being the earliest adopter
    - Fairchild Semiconductor was one of the earliest entrants into the field, and many of the men involved in this venture created their own venture capital vehicles (Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia) ... **birth of venture capital allowed funds to diversify easily, but also represented a return to American roots aka raising venture capital for the Mayflower journey**
- Warren Buffet decided that he wanted to shut down Berkeshire Hathaway's unprofitable textile divisions - manufacturing was a zero-sum game, had to choose between paying workers or lower prices for consumers ... more shares were being distributed, which often meant that eighties finance = battleground between shareholders + management 
    - <mark>Corporations vs capitalists ... corporations served multiple interests, stakeholders, employees, vendors, communities, but capitalists were focused solely on their shareholders</mark>
- Many black men aspired for social mobility - often this was achieved through sports or music ... by 80's whites had fled urban core of cities -> departing businesses -> loss of jobs ... how were black people supposed to "pick themselves up by the bootstraps" when they had been enslaved, legally segregated, denied access to housing, loans, etc?
- Bill Clinton + Al Gore talked about this idea of an information superhighway that would connect homes ... let to the dot-com boom and the dot-com bust
    - **Bust was a result of belief that markets were always rational (efficient market hypothesis = market price an expression of collective insight/wisdom) ... but it was clear that certain companies were very mispriced** and that the market was collectively irrational 
    - World Wide Web had British + European roots, but America had the venture captial to finance it and tolerate operating losses for years 
- Implosion of internet companies good for Apple/Jobs, began to close up American facilities in favor of foreign third parties
    - Rebirth of Apple facilitated by modern communism - evidence was capitalism being superior though came from North Korea vs South Korea and East Germany vs West Germany 
    - For many consumers, smartphone replaced the computer altogether (in third world countries especially) ... it was their first introduction to the internet, which was also boosted by social networks
