**The history of the Premier League can be divided into 6 main eras**
<ul>
<li><mark>1992 - 1996</mark>: backpass rule change, introduction of second striker and withdrawn forwards, Arsenal bringing foreign innovation to the league </li>
<li><mark>1996 - 2002</mark>: Bosmian case, strikers relied on more pace causing defenders to become faster, Ferguson introducing concept of squad rotation, role of center forward evolving </li>
<li><mark>2002 - 2007</mark>: introduction of the holding midfield 'Makelele' role, more defensive tactics with Mourinho/Benitez, Lampard/Gerrard/Scholes leading era of 3-man midfield</li>
<li><mark>2007 - 2012</mark>: Manchester United's peak without a genuine striker, inverted wingers, Barcelona possession football, importance of attacking midfielders (Silva, Mata, Cazorla)</li>
<li><mark>2012 - 2017</mark>: introduction of pressing (Southampton, Tottenham, Liverpool), Leicester counter-attacking approach, Guardiola's inverted full-backs and Conte's 3-man defense</li>
</ul>

<mark>Premier League has become more stylistically diverse, but always retained an English identity ... due to environment = colder climate -> faster play, wetter pitches -> more ball in area, lenient officials -> harder for flair players, supporters -> cheers for winning corners + thunderous tackles</mark>  
<br/>



- The **introduction of the backpass rule significantly changed football and caused football to deviate away from this 'Route One' style**, and into defenders/goalkeepers being forced to become comfortable playing in possession ... <mark>1992</mark>
    - Some teams simply played hopeful balls in behind the defense and tried to capitalize on errors
    - Goalkeepers like Van der Saar and Peter Schmeichel (this guy still had a lot of errors though) leading the way into new era for goalkeepers -> shift towards foreign talent from homegrown talen
- Eric Cantona signalled the arrival of a new type of player into the Premier League - not a center forward, or a midfielder - but a second striker, someone who roamed between the lines ... <mark>1992 - 1993</mark>
    - Brought forth the **idea of freeing players from their defensive responsibilities, opponents weren't structured to stop Cantona** as center backs fought the center forwards and midfielders 
- Blackburn showed the power of keeping traditional strike partners with SAS (Sutton and Shearer) while Newcastle displayed some of the league's first truly attacking football ... <mark>1994 - 1995</mark>
    - Blackburn instructed wingers to dribble towards goal and come short if they didn't have a clear path - one of the 2 strikers would then drift wide to collect the ball and cross it into the center
- **Cantona started the revolution of acquiring withdrawn forwards - Bergkamp, Zola**... however, attacking midfielders such as Juninho, Kinkladze, and Le Tissier still had problems adjusting this relatively deeper role ... <mark>1995</mark>
    - 4-4-2 formations abroad were accomodating these withdrawn forwards on the wing instead, which wasn't their best position 
- Arsenal in the mid 90's were the template for modern football and the introduction of Wenger had a huge impact culturally on the Premier League going forward ... <mark>1996</mark>
    - **Wenger acted more as a teacher than a football manager - especially changed the importance of diet, stretching sessions** - but still wasn't a great tactician, rarely making changes based on the opponent 
    - 3-5-2 proved to be a good way to neutralize the 4-4-2 with an extra midfielder, especially with Viera and Petit bossing the middle  
<br/>
<br/>

- As teams started to play **higher lines to keep forwards as far away from the goal as possible, other teams started to exploit this by deploying speedsters** (Anelka, Owen), leading to defenders becoming faster ... <mark>1996 - 1997</mark>
    - Teams (especially smaller teams) began to counter speedsters by defending incredibly deep, which neutralized speed in favor of aerial power
- Ferguson introduced the idea of tinkering with squads to match up against specific opposition and more broadly squad rotation - this kept players fresh, backups happy, and allowed to exploit opponent's weaknesses ... <mark>1998</mark>
    - Man U's 1998/1999 campaign was the greatest season in English football, included Cantona, Bekham, Neville, Giggs, Irwin, Keane, Scholes meaning the midfield had a crosser, a tackler, a passer, and a dribbler
    - United were becoming more intelligent and **tactically flexible as Ferguson was able to see how other European teams played (Ajax's sweeper, Milan's compactness, Barcelona's possession)**
- The Bosman case was influential in **abolishing the foreign quota system and thus allowed the Premier League to incorporate stylistic components for each position from abroad** ... <mark>1995 - 1998</mark>
    - Initially could only deploy 3 foreign players, but Bosman case ruled that players as workers should have access to free movement across the EU
- Sam Allardyce brought back antiquated 'Route One' football into the modern era, but also introduced many other innovations such as a higher emphasis on statistics and using anything to your advantage .. <mark>1999 onwards</mark>
- The role of the center forward was now evolving and the conflict between Henry and Van Nistelrooy made this quite apparent - **the times emphasized this old-school, aerial, poacher approach, but in hindsight we see that the player that could assist, create, served more importance**  .... <mark>2001 onwards</mark>
    - Van Nistelrooy's greatest strength was that he scored an equal amount of goals at home as away, and only one from outside the penalty area - he was a poacher in the purest terms, but he could finish
    - Henry, on the other hand, was converted from a left winger into a center forward which meant he offered much more - he was great at cutting in from the left and scoring (the Robben before the Robben)
<ul>
<li>As pacier strikers became much more common, the Premier League began to realize the importance of pacy defenders - Rio Ferdinand and the Arsenal Invicibles backline was the best example of this ... <mark>2002</mark></li>
</ul> <br/>

- The transition from purely physical midfielders that pushed up and down the pitch to a midfielder that played right in front of the defense was exemplified by Makelele - he created this urge to deploy a "holding midfield" role ... <mark>2003</mark>
    - Mourinho highlighted why this role worked so well - **in a diamond midfield, you were essentially played 3 midfielders against 2 and if the wingers helped mark the extra man, there was space in behind to exploit** ... CREATE AN OVERLOAD
    - As teams tried to find their own "Makelele," they increasingly took creative attacking midfielders and moved them to this new role (since there was more space and time)
- Mourinho revolutionized the **Premier League's emphasis on defense, specifically emphasizing the period of transition from attack to defense and defense to attack, leading to counter-attacking opportunities** ... <mark>2004</mark>
    - The addition of Robben led to even more dangerous counterattacks, as the wingers had one goal: collect the ball deep and sprint towards goal
    - The idea of the 'transition' started to become more important - sprinting forward when gaining possession, retreating immediately when the ball is lost 
- Benitez deployed similar tactics to Mourinho, and both wanted glory and to be in control - **confirms the idea that for coaches that were unable to make it as players did not believe in individual talent of players, they created a system that instead emphasized the collective structure** ... Mourinho's 4-3-3 and Benitez's 4-2-3-1 ... <mark>2004</mark>
    - Benitez thought of players as chess pieces, used four natural center backs and then four central midfielders ... no space for opposition, kept emphasizing compactness
    - Tactics such as moving the fullbacks inside made it hard to break down the smaller teams, but Liverpool performed brilliantly against the bigger team
<ul> <li>
As the Premier League moved from 2 midfielders to 3 midfielders, Lampard, Gerrard, and Scholes led the way not only for the league but also England in attempting to create diversity in the midfield ... <mark>2004</mark>
</li></ul><br/>

- United became one of the most **tactically flexible sides in the Premier League with Ronaldo, Tevez, Rooney** ... they were playing without a genuine striker but could function as a possession team, counter-attacking team or defensive team ... <mark>2007</mark>
- Pulis went back to the basics with his approach at Stoke, and the stadium condition in which they played gave the 'wet and windy night' description ... <mark>2007 onwards</mark>
    - Had some tricks up his sleeve, like playing on minimum possible size regulation field, leaving grass long in the middle, and practicing on the field more the game to scuff up the middle 
- Redknapp's Spurs used Bale/Lennon on their natural side and made them hug the touchline, while Hodgson's Fulham had inverted wingers that started on their opposite sides and cut in (had to be good with both feet for this) ... <mark>2007 onwards</mark>
    - **Inverted wingers arose because of 2 main reasons = rise of attacking full-back, meaning that stretching play + crossing was covered by full-back and football now based around passing combinations** ... crossing vs through balls
- Italian coaches were known for being astute tacticians, which led to many of them being hired by Premier League teams: Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pelegrini, and Roberto Di Matteo ... <mark>2009 onwards</mark>
- Barcelona spread possession football throughout Europe, with a standard template for midfielders - **Busquets sitting deep, Xavi on the right orchestrating play, with Iniesta going forward to attack** ... <mark>2009 onwards</mark>
    - Focus was on short passing - tiki-taka, which was initially used to describe unnecessary short passing
    - Teams used possession and attacking more patiently as a force of defending almost - Brendan Rodger's Swansea was the perfect example of this, and they kept the ball in deep areas for long periods of time 
- Now that central midfielders were considered in more ball-playing terms rather that solely English terms (moving around pitch and battling hard), we saw a shift towards attacking midfielders + center forwards <mark>2010 onwards</mark>
    - Silva, Mata and Cazorla were all very versatile and often saw themselves **deployed from wide positions, which allowed them to pop up unannounced ... attacking midfielders who cross play on natural side while those who shoot play on the opposite side**
- Liverpool in 2012/2013 were the first example of a team that was playing post-possession football - making the most tackles and scoring counter-attacking goals (opposite of what Rodgers wanted) ... <mark>2012</mark>
    - Biggest irony of Gerrard's slip versus Chelsea = said 'this does not slip' but also that he was only moved to this deeper position because his head movement was not adequate enough ... his head movement is the reason he slipped  
    <br/>

- Teams such as Southampton, Tottenham and Liverpool were embracing pressing and all coaches (Villas-Boas, Pochettino, Klopp) offered their own unique styles of pressing ... <mark>2013 onwards</mark>
    - **Pressing wasn't a new tactic - major feature of Ajax and Netherlands national team in the 1970's** ... also employed by England coach Graham Taylor
    - Re-popularized by Pep Guardiola's Barcelona in 2010/2011, because he knew they were a much better team with the ball than without the ball
    - Andre Villas-Boas = high defenseive block, but failed ... Pochettino did something similar, but was more successful (highest average possession share, fifth highest pass competion ... should be linked)
    - Klopp favored gegenpressing, which focus more on the timing rather than the actual positioning itself ... in possession -> defensive transition -> out of possession -> attacking transition = 4  stages
    - Pressing works well against big teams, but teams struggle a bit against smaller teams that are very compact defensively 
- Ranieri's Leicester embraced a counter-attacking approach with Mahrez, Drinkwater, Kante, Albrighton, Okazaki and Vardy and focused on scoring on set pieces and Ranieri tinkering with the tactics ... <mark>2015</mark>
- Arrival of Conte and Guardiola into Premier League now meant it was destination for top class coaching talent, with Guardiola instructing full-backs to tuck inside as central midfielders (also had to cope with important of winning balls in the air) and Conte moving to a 3-man defense that utilized a libero (slightly unbalanced in terms of full-backs + center-backs)... <mark>2016</mark>
