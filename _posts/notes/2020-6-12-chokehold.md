**Main points**
- <mark>Police work can turn decent men into ones that contribute to the crisis ... the Chokehold is the black experience in America, self-reinforcing system of controlling them</mark>
    - Allows police to get away with excessive force + racial profiling (feature of the system) -> system of inequality keeps the whites rich and powerful by reducing competition for jobs and generating employment in law enforcement + corrections
    - Stop and frisk, mass incarceration, war on drugs
    - Keeping African-Americans down, then blaming them for their own degradation
    - Chokehold = employment-stimulus plan for working class white people
- <mark>Poverty worse for blacks than whites (limits middle class blacks more than lower class whites), bc low-income blacks live in more economically segregated areas, so don't have same proximity to middle-class and access to better schools, health, upwards mobility</mark>
    - FHA declined to insure mortgages where black people lived + redlined excluded black people from these nicer areas
- <mark>Analogy that compares white supremacy to capitalism ... whites anti-competitively excluded people of color as they gained power/status, then used that power to lock in standards of competition that favored whites</mark>

**Chapter summaries**
 - First we **construct the African-American man as a potential criminal, and then we use legal response to justify containing these "threats"** ... association of African-American men with criminality a calculated ploy to preserve white priviledge after slavery 
    - Excessive force, harsh punishment, mass incarceration, erosion of civil liberties intended for African-American men
    - Dehumanization thesis presents black males as apes
    - Black people shouldn't have to "apologize for their existence" 
- We use our anxieties about African-American men to justify one of the harshest punishment regimes in the world -> defining/investigating/punishing crime all centered around African-American men
    - Existence of misconduct insurance proves that police aware of systemic issues ... most power change = misconduct insurance companies to pull out
    - Widespread use of guns 
    - US police officers given superpowers 
        - Scott vs Harris = License to kill, even for a dumb crime like speeding
        - Atwater v Lago Vista = police can take you to jail in processing any crime, even if the punishment for that crime includes no prison time 
        - Whren vs United States = if cops have legitimate reason, can make a stop - actual motive of cop does not matter 
    - **Most crimes African-Americans arrested for because police are hunting them down ... arresting for low-level crime so they can search you -> misdimeanor arrests = enrolling black men in criminal justice system -> if you have one conviction, you are more likely to get another**
    - Heroin addicts vs crack epidemic
    - **The Plan = middle-class white people moving African-Americans out of inner cities (gentrification) + using police to make white people feel safe** -> Williamsburg Effect = wealthier, more educated people on juries -> trust the police more -> more convictions
    - Look into interest convergence to make a difference
- The **purpose of stop and frisks has never been to actually make arrests, it has been used as a tool of "psychological warfare"** -> creates the impression that police are omnipotent ... meant to give an excuse to search people, and deter people from carrying contraband
    - "Reasonable suspicion" is such a vague and broad term ... can consider race
    - Stop and frisk kinda like a torture-lit, intent is to humiliate and control, signalling that the police control the streets
    - Police can stop you if you try to evade them IN HIGH-CRIME AREAS
    - Fortunately, we have been able to reduce stop and frisk a bit  
<br/>

- Black on black violence a real problem ... **African-Americans do commit disproportionate share of serious crime, but also disproportionately the victims** ... but they don't get away with it, COPS DO -> we view black men from the lens of criminality, everyone overestimates their chances of being the victim of crime tho
    - "War on drugs" selectively waged against African Americans (13% of those that commit crime, 60% of those that do time) .... Nixon always thought that the problem was black people, but couldn't criminalize being black or poor -> criminalize their common pleasure, make it out to be a bigger health issue than it really was 
    - Culture determined by environment, when environment filled with rejecting education, gravitating towards drugs, gangs, need to fix that ... government creates this madness
- Many programs we have created to help African-Americans end up hurting them, because they designate their problems as being a part of their own upbringing/actions ... not only do they ignore the problems black woman face, but they ended up blaming the victim -> we ignore the real issue of white priviledge 
    - Focus on how black men respond to society instead of how society responds to the black man
    - My Brother's Keeper = mentoring, job training, college prep ... but Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown didn't need any of those
    - **African-American men feel the most empowered by fighting the stereotypes that white priviledge has established of them**, defining their own sense of what it means to be a black man  
<br/>

- 4 main ways to frame this crisis in order to determine how to reform it ... it is **clear that the last frame is most effective**, seeing white society/privilege as a monopoloy that has anti-competitively excluded people of color and then used power to lock in standards of competition that favors whites ... can't just rely on the Constitution to protect black people, as it actually aids police abusers
    - <mark>Frame 1 = more African-Americans need to obey the law (black male programs view it from this lense)</mark>
    - <mark>Frame 2 = under-enforcement of the law, actually need more enforcement, proponents see tensions with community as necessary to maintain public safety</mark>
    - <mark>Frame 3 = need to focus on relationship with community</mark>
    - <mark>Frame 4 = police brutality a resuly of systemic issues and white supremacy, need a systemic change to fix relationship between police and black people</mark>
- Fact of reality is that racial inequality a big problem in the US ... we assume that putting people in jail is the moral decision to make since people choose to act in their own "free will" (way more complicated than this) ... take police funds and put them somewhere else, aka community health care
    - Research suggest that we can release about 40% of the prison population with no harm to public, 25% are drug offenses and 15% have been locked up for such a long time that taxpayer money being wasted
    - During the Civil Rights era, most reformers tried to stay away from the topic of criminal justice reform ... didn't want to be seen as associating with criminals
    - Threat of violence and law-breaking can have a real impact on making change
