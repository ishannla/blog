**Main points**
- <mark>Connected all computers into a network together -> uploaded all of humanity's collective information to this network -> made this network searchable -> tied in our commerce systems, financial systems, media systems, etc into this network -> unlimited selection, instant gratification</mark>
    - Personal computing turned into intimate computing
- <mark>If the Web 1.0 was all about consuming content (marked by Netscape IPO), then Web 2.0 was all about users producing content (marked by Google IPO)</mark> 
    - Was now a lot easier to found a web-focused company since bandwidth was cheap and open-source tools were widely available
    - YouTube was perfect example of a company that utilized virality to share content, they allowed any video to be embedded into any part of the internet by simply copy-pasting a few lines of HTML -> start of internet meme and social media celebrity culture
    - The social graph was the key innovation of Web 2.0, leading to companies like Friendster and MySpace helping you with online-dating and connecting with your friends
- <mark>Not all ideas were bad however, some were good but just too early for their time ... mySpace and Desktop.com doing virtual hard drive storage (cloud) and eCircles doing online photo albums</mark>

**Chapter summaries**
- just like the internet hooked up a bunch of computers together, the world wide web was essentially a collection of links that allowed navigation among themselves
- **Netscape started the gold rush for everyone, beforehand you had to know how to use UNIX to properly navigate the web** 
    - More people got online -> more people fascinated by the web and wanted to build their own sites -> people became obsessed with idea of a platform, owning all underlying applications on their software 
- Bill Gates always had the idea of an **information superhighway, where you could buy things, watch movies, and talk to your friends all from one device** - he thought this would be the TV, but in reality the information superhighway was already here and being delivered through the internet 
    - Gates grew up in a different age and didn't realize how wide-spread the internet was becoming, attributing its use only to "computer geeks" 
    - Gates also didn't exactly know how to monetize the internet since everything was free, thought it would be better to focus on a carefully controlled user experience, ex: Windows
- there was now **two business models companies could focus on - connecting people to the internet, or internet services/browser wars** ... Microsoft chose the latter 
    - AOL provided people both a dial-up modem connection to access the internet and also internet services that they could use ... these internet services were more like "walled gardens" and competed directly with the world wide web 
    - It was AOL's huge marketing efforts and brand that ultimately kept it alive for as long as it was, despite competition from the world wide web and later telephone companies that were investing in underground internet cable
- companies like Pathfinder had finally discovered a viable business model that could support the free services on the internet - advertiser supported ads
    - Inherent conflict between low internet speeds and banner ads, as internet speeds could not support the loading of these banner ads initially 
    - **Internet also disrupted the advertiser model itself**, as ads delivered via radio/TV were passive, but ads delivered via the internet allowed for clicking via links, measuring engagement, etc  
<br/>

- **Yahoo was the first truly web-only company that could not have existed without the web**, relied purely on traffic from consumers and did not provide any software or services to businesses 
    - While investors were initially dubious of Yahoo's business model, Yahoo believed that they had a key advantage in that they were the first to market, meaning that Yahoo had a brand name 
    - Yahoo started to offer a bunch of other services (mail, news, etc) on their website in order to keep user's attention 
- Amazon's e-commerce technology would not have been possible without the creation of SSL (Secure Socket Layer) by Netscape
    - Bezos started out in books because he felt it was such a basic commodity, you knew that the book was going to be the same regardless of where you bought it from 
    - The one element of a physical bookstore that he wanted to emulate was recommendations - with cookies, Amazon kept track of your purchasing history across other sites, other user's purchases and would recommend you books
    - **Physical sectors like Barnes and Nobles now had their business stolen from them, every physical sector was now afraid that they were going to get "Amazon-ed"** -> contributed to the dot-com bubble
- Ebay came up with some of the first innovative ideas that would ultimately find themselves into modern internet companies 
    - The **idea that communities could be created and maintained based on a user rating system, the idea that small businesses could now be founded on the internet**, the idea of a virtual platform 
    - In a perfect marketplace, buyer and seller arrive at a price together ... AuctionWeb did this, but on the internet allowing people to sell niche goods from all across the world
    - Idea of a virtual platform was Ebay's most important innovation, Ebay has no assets (didn't actually deliver any goods) other than its virtual marketplace, it's community, it's users  
<br/>

- Now that baby-boomers were reaching their mid-40's/50's, were started to think of investing so that they could save for their retirement 
    - Mountain of wealth from their prime earning years and democratization of investing (CNBC/retail investing platforms) meant lots of money going into market 
    - **Institutional investors no longer cared about evaluating companies based on these commonly used metrics (income, etc**) and instead were investing in any .com company, even ones with shady business plans
- Internet companies now focused on two main strategies - Get Big Fast (inspired by Amazon) and spending a lot of money of branding/advertising to ensure that they were the leader in their market sector (inspired by Yahoo)
    - Essentially, **consumers were being offered cheap services that were being subsidized by VC money** ... goal was to get them to stay with the platform, but consumers would often switch from platform to platform 
- One could argue that one of the main reasons that **so many companies were able to flourish during the dot-com era was because the #1 player was distracted, bc Microsoft had to worry about the constantly implications of the anti-trust lawsuit**, they missed paid search and social networks 
    - Idea that American financial system rigged in favor for the 1% came from the dot-com burst, while hard-working Americans lost everything so many bankers and investors walked away rich 
    - <mark>One positive of the dot-com era was that cable companies had overextended themselves and laid out a bunch of broadband, ensuring that the tracks were in place for cheap and fast internet connections later on</mark>

- Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page had an analogy for a search engine that resembled citations in a research paper ... sending out web crawlers to determine how many times a page was linked to allowed them to determine a page's relevancy 
    - First wanted to license out their PageRank technology to other search engines, but decided to build out their own business after they were told no
    - Google essentially was an anti-Silicon Valley type company, didn't believe in the Get Big Fast model and worked endlessly on improving their core product
    - **Overture had the idea of putting ads next to relevant searches to reach consumers at point of intentionality - Google took this work to the next level with their "pay-per-click" model** and auctioning off ads, was a win-win-win for advertisers, consumers, and Google -> AdWords then allowed people to let Google take care of ads on their own sites
- **Napster trained a new generation of people to expect infinite selection and instant gratification**, but their idea didn't work because record label companies were too stubborn to adapt to new consumer behaviour
    - Napster's technology allowed for a completely new way to distribute media, and while they new that this could be used for piracy quite easily, they tried to argue that should not blame the technology for user's actions 
    - Napster's original goal was to never maintain this platform of piracy, but instead to bring all music-listening owners to their platform and then use their leverage into signing a deal with the record label companies
- Now that record companies sales were down about 10% in 2002, Steve Jobs was able to leverage them into a new business model that benefitted consumers by allowing them to purchase individual songs instead of albums
    - Release of iTunes -> dominated about 70% of the MP3 sales market, and then also came the release of the iPod 
    - Netflix also embraced this infinite selection instant gratification model by allowing people to rent DVDs online, their recommendation engine differentiated them from Blockbuster by allowing them to make the most use of their existing inventory
- PayPal tied people's email addresses to their own bank account, and this integrated very well with Ebay's model 
    - **What made PayPal so popular was the network effect they generated - the more buyers asked to be paid via PayPal, the more sellers were incentivized to sign up for PayPal accounts**  
<br/>

- Thefacebook was attempting to mirror your real-world social connections in the digital world and **Zuckerbergs's obsession with data led him to analyze user behavior and experiment with how tiny changes to the algorithm would modify this behavior** 
    - Zuckerberg had this premise that humans are highly social beings and care about knowing what's happening in their circles, this would keep them glued to the platform
    - Tagging as a distribution system was the perfect example of the network effect in action - whenever you were tagged in something, you would immediately want to see that content 
    - The reason that Facebook gained critical mass was because it arose as that same time as another technology ... smartphones
- Newton MessagePad -> PalmPilot -> RIM Blackberry (early 2000's) - first device to automatically sync with your email, allowed you to always be connected to information 
    - <mark>Entire computing industry was converging onto one device that everyone would always carry with them everywhere that connected them to all their information, but it seemed like most people in the industry didn't seem to care</mark>
- Apple knew they with adding radio waves to the iPod, they would be able to create the perfect smartphone ... however, somewhere along the way they decided to split their smartphone project into two branches, one based on the iPod and one based on this new multi-touch finger tracking technology
    - This new device was truly the internet in your pocket according to Steve Jobs, but it is really the **creation of the App Store that took the phone from simpy being used by early adopters to a more widespread audidence**
    - Software was the key differentiator as Bill Gates had always predicted
