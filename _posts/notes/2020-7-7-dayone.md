**Main points**
- <mark>Although tech has brought many innovations to the common man, this techno-utopian view most of us and these employees propogate draws us away from the very real issues that many of these tech companies cause</mark>
    - Facebook, Google have killed local news businesses by sucking up most of the ad revenue, about 60% of ad revenue in the US ... Amazon may imitate the products of various sellers on their platform, thus displacing their businesses 
    - Most of us find our main sense of meaning in our lives from our friends and family, but technology has given us constant social stimulation to the point where we have lost empathy 
- <mark>If we look at common themes between these succesful companies, focusing less on execution work and giving more time for idea work seems to be at the forefront ... however, schools have not adjusted to this and are instead focusing on drilling memorization, repetition, RISK MITIGATION</mark>
    - Additionally, if look at many of the problems that companies have been having with AI (especially algorithmic bias), they can remedy this by sharing their training data with other companies or making other companies aware whenever they experience a problem 
- <mark>If we look at innovative products that come out of these companies or acquisitions that they make, these products can easily be buried unless companies find ways to deploy them in a way such that they don't compete with existing businesses</mark>


**Chapter summaries**
- if you look specifically at the CEOs of the worlds biggest tech companies right now, we'll see that they differ from previous CEOs in that **they do not focus on selling, dictating, giving answers ... they are focusing on facilitating and asking questions**
    - companies that do not embrace the Day One culture are bound to end up in Day Two - stasis, regression, destruction 
    - every company has to keep inventing to stay unique since it is now so easy for startups to come - **cost to create is now much lower - this is different than big companies hunkering down and protecting their competitive advantage**
    - companies finding innovative ways to not only free their employees of execution work using AI tools but also help elevate employee ideas from lower levels to higher levels ... the only company that hasn't embraced this is Apple  
<br/>

- Amazon brings ideas from employees to executives using their 6 page memo format, which forces innovation to come from both thinking and doing 
    - Bezo's obsession with robots one example of how the company plans on minimizing execution work ... addition of robots normally means creation of more technical and specialized jobs 
    - **minimize the number of decisions that employees/managers have to make with AI** - for instance, using historical data to predict how much inventory for a certain product needed at a given time at their fulfillment centers 
    - most of the vendor manager jobs no longer rely on predicting inventory, but troubleshooting these algorithms when things go wrong, such as messing with the inputs, etc  
<br/>

- Facebook also focuses on a feedback culture to help ideas rises to the top (state a fact, share your story, make an ask), and is crucial for them since they don't maintain a popular operating system, people can switch at any time 
    - **best example of feedback culture working well is Facebook's switch to mobile ... Zuckerberg wanted to stick with the "wrapper" version of the app** since it allowed for easy updates but performance suffered, native mobile version allowed them to introduce banner ads which now account for 90% of revenue 
    - other changes required after introduction of feed (people saw more milestone posts, so felt less comfortable sharing day-to-day activities) -> renewed focus on groups/messaging for more intimate connections and also stories for more fleeting moments 
    - introduction of ML from face.com important for face-tagging, which harnessed the true power of Facebook's network effects 
    - **problem with Facebook's feedback culture is that although it brought different opinions to the top, Facebook still dominated by a group of techno-optimists that thought that Facebook was de facto good** -> blinded them from evaluating the true impacts of their technology, for instance hate speech Myanmar 
    - Zuckerberg's version of future centered around people ... right now we choose a task and then a person which is opposite of human nature, since we want to pick a person and then a task  
<br/>

- Google has also been forced to re-invent itself, going from first a search engine to a web browser to a mobile interface 
    - **Google didn't want to have to rely on Microsoft/IE for people to access their search engine (since Microsoft could easily divert to its own search engine), so they decide to go on the attack** and offer a web-based alternatives to compete with Microsoft's productivity tools such as Outlook 
    - put Microsoft in an interesting position ... should they focus on improving IE so that these browser-based apps run better or forcefully slow down IE? chose the latter, allowing Google to come in with its own web browser 
    - with the introduction of mobile, Google once again felt the need to reinvent itself as more and more time was being spent in apps rather than on a web browser -> **introduction of AI into all of its tools, leading to integration between different apps like Calendar, Gmail, etc**
    - growth of employees within Google brought up the question as to whether culture can scale? with internal communication tools, employees are always going to share dissenting opinions, which may not align with Google's view (memo on women in tech, response to Andy Rubin sexual harassement)  
<br/>

- Apple's culture serves as an antithesis to Amazon, Facebook, Google since it does emphasize the Engineer's mindset and instead focuses on the ideas flowing through hierarchy from the top 
    - Steve Jobs era: he would suggest a product, and then everyone else would put all their time and attention toward ensuring that every detail of the product was carefully evaluated ... Tim Cooks era: similar, but focus on minimizing distractions so that people can fully focus on the product -> designers dictate the product, engineers make it possible 
    - **Apple emphasizes secrecy over collaboration, which led to strategic problems with Siri** since they only viewed it as fun personality add-on to the iPhone, when an assistant could have been so much more ... similar experience with HomePod, which was a disaster 
    - much of its internal infrastructure build by external contractors which has led to a lot of problems where this software has to be re-written ... larger problem in tech: contractors not treated or paid very well 
    - Apple invested in privacy, does not see customers as the product  
<br/>

- Microsoft acquired this startup aQuantive, a digital marketing company led by young, innovative entrepreneurs but upon bringing them into the bloated, bureacratic culture of Microsoft had to write off their investment bc of the culture clash - managers were rewarded for strangling ideas 
    - **conflict between asset milkers and future starters ... main debate was over Microsoft's Server & Tools business**, which allowed people to build/host applications for desktops ... but future was on the cloud -> Microsoft embracing cloud would mean no longer emphasizing strength of Windows, Office, pricey server tools
    - when Nadella took over, he was more worried about the culture part than the strategy part and wanted to make Microsoft appealing to employees with big ideas that weren't necessarily related to refining Windows/Office 
    - **one of the biggest successes of Microsoft was getting into the cloud space by offering hybrid solutions, meaning the CIO's were now more incentivized to make the partial jump over to cloud** 
    - Nadella realized that middle management brought most of the glut ... more employees seeking management roles -> more managers -> more meetings -> more memos -> less actual innovation
