Hello! 

I am a recent graduate of the [Paul G. Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, where I majored in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. My interests center around computer security + information systems. 

This fall, I will be joining Microsoft’s [Security & Compliance](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/SCCIntroPage) team within Office 365. 

I’ll be using this space to explore **intersections between tech, business, and public policy**. 
By looking into historical trends within these areas, *I hope to reflect on where society is heading*. 

In my free time, I enjoy watching the Premier League, rock climbing (here’s a [compilation](https://vsco.co/ishannla/gallery) of some of my recent climbs), and firing up my Xbox for some [FIFA/Halo](https://vimeo.com/user116679776). 

## Previously,

Fall ’20: At the [ICTD](https://ictd.cs.washington.edu) lab, I contributed to the [Open Data Kit](https://odk-x.org) project by helping automate the deployment of microservices our tool needed to sync app data/files. Documentation [here](https://docs.odk-x.org/sync-endpoint-setup/). 

Summer ’19: Within [Microsoft’s S&C](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/SCCIntroPage) group, I worked on the URL effectiveness team and built a tool to manage our [detonation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2017/01/25/evolving-office-365-advanced-threat-protection-with-url-detonation-and-dynamic-delivery/) traffic, helping us better detect phishing campaigns in real-time. 

Summer ’18: At [MAQ Software](https://maqsoftware.com), I built an open-source Powerpoint add-in that allowed users to directly embed dynamic PowerBI charts into their presentations. Documentation [here](https://github.com/ishannla/PowerBIEmbed).
