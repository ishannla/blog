Hello! 

I am a recent graduate of the [Paul G. Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the University of Washington, where I majored in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. My interests center around computer security + information systems. 

This fall, I will be joining Microsoft‚Äôs [Security & Compliance](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/SCCIntroPage) team within Office 365. 

I‚Äôll be using this space to explore **intersections between tech, business, and public policy**. 
By looking into historical trends within these areas, *I hope to reflect on where society is heading*. 

In my free time, I enjoy watching the Premier League, rock climbing (here‚Äôs a [compilation](https://vsco.co/ishannla/gallery) of some of my recent climbs), and firing up my Xbox for some [FIFA/Halo](https://vimeo.com/user116679776). 

## Previously,

I'm majoring in Urban Planning with Computer Science & minoring in Comparative Media Studies. On campus, I dance, (try to) sing, & fry eggs at midnight with my friends.

This summer, I‚Äôm doing technical marketing at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) & a retreat at the [Recurse Center](recurse.com). At the [Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu/), I'm making a website to visualize air pollution data collected by sensors installed on garbage trucks and taxis.

## ü¶ï What I've done before

Last summer, I interned at [Repl.it](https://repl.it/), an online code editor supporting 50+ programming languages & a community of 2 million makers.

During high school, I organized [hackathons](http://mahacks.com/) & attempted bioinformatics research. I founded [Science and Us](http://scienceandus.org/) to introduce teens to the careers and anti-disciplinary mindset of science communication.

When I was 11, I loved Percy Jackson so much I ended up self-studying Modern Greek for 3 years, running a [linguistics Tumblr](http://subjunctivelymoody.tumblr.com/), and teaching myself Latin.
